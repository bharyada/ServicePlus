<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<hr/>
</div>
<div className="col-sm-6 wow bounceInLeft">
<div className="boxes">
<p className="quet_box">How is the cost of the movement determined?</p>
<p className="ans_box">
There are several factors which determine the price of the shifting process carried out by the packers and movers. The factors are mentioned below:
The number of items to be shifted is the primary price determinants. As the number of items increases so does the price. Normally, the items which can be adjusted in one truck will cost the same amount even if the objects vary in size or material.
The distance of the initial place to the new location is also directly proportional to the cost of the package. Longer distance implies more cost.

<div className="boxes">
<p className="quet_box">Should packing and moving be carried out by two different companies or should the task be handed over to the same company?</p>
<p className="ans_box">
There are many companies which perform only packing or only moving jobs. You may lure into hiring such companies for both of the works; however, do yourself a great favor by not hiring two companies for shifting. It should be understood that packing and moving are just the parts of a single complete process, i.e. shifting, and the process should be done by a single company. In the case of damage or loss, when there are two different companies, no one will take the responsibility of the eventuality. On the other hand, if there is one single packer and movers firm in action, it has to recover your loss and be answerable to you.

<p className="quet_box">Is vehicle shifting possible with packers and movers? If yes then how?</p>
<p className="ans_box">
Yes, the facility of vehicle shifting is offered by most of the packers and movers in the country. Normally, the two-wheelers, three-wheelers, or four-wheelers are loaded onto a truck for shifting. The vehicle is sealed and packed safely; extra precautions are always taken to avoid dents and scratches. The drivers of the trucks make sure that the drive is safe, break-free, nonjumpy, and with the minimum jerks possible.

<p className="quet_box">Can the goods get damaged even when they are in the hands of professionals?</p>
<p className="ans_box">
Although it is always best to let the professionals handle the packing and moving of goods, it cannot be said that the goods are 100% safe. The packers and movers try best to pack the goods safely and shift them with even more care; however, unforeseen circumstances can occur anytime. An accident or a mishap can take place which can damage your goods.

<div className="boxes">
<p className="quet_box">Should the goods be insured?</p>
<p className="ans_box">
As mentioned earlier, the goods can get damaged, broken or lost even by the movers and packers; therefore, the client should make sure that he has got his belongings insured beforehand so that he can recover the loss.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div className="col-sm-6 wow bounceInRight">
<div className="boxes">
<p className="quet_box">Why do I require insurance if everything is packed professionally?</p>
<p className="ans_box">
 You must get your goods insured even when they are packed professionally as it would save you from any financial loss in case the items are damaged or cracked due to unpredicted happenings such as fire, accidents, sabotage, disturbances etc during the moving process.

<p className="quet_box">What are my liabilities throughout the moving process?</p>
<p className="ans_box">
You don’t have to worry about much during the moving process as most of the things are taken care by us. However, you will have to supply a variety of documents etc that would be necessary for a number of formalities. It is recommended that you talk about this carefully with your packing and moving firm.

<p className="quet_box">What happens to my goods once they are packed and moved from my residence?</p>
<p className="ans_box">
All of your belongings are moved directly from door to door without any transshipment. Nonetheless, for small quantity or part loads - the goods will be moved to our storehouse and clubbed with other goods before they are sent off.

<p className="quet_box">Can I also pack my goods myself?</p>
<p className="ans_box">
