                <div class='Title_h2'>How is a Commercial Move Different?</div>
                <p>
                  Unlike <i>domestic relocation</i>, office shifting involves a
                  lot of tasks like- computer and file transfer, equipment and
                  furniture moving. All these things need to be done carefully
                  as any piece misplaced can be a cause for the future loss.
                  Office relocation can only be carried out by professionals as
                  they have expertise. Domestic move only involves moving of
                  your personal stuff but here there is a lot of stuff which if
                  misplaced can cost you a dime as these things are official and
                  will help you a lot in future earnings.
